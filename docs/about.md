# About

The Haig Fras Digital Twin project aims to establish a system representing a Digital Twin for the Haig Fras environmental protection area in the Celtic Sea.

## Definition

An environmental digital twin is a virtual representation or model of a physical environment. This digital twin is created using various data sources, including sensor data, satellite imagery, geospatial information, and other relevant data sources.

Key characteristics and functionalities of an environmental digital twin include:

1. **Real-time Data Integration:** Environmental digital twins often incorporate real-time data streams.

2. **Visualization:** They enable the visualization of the environment in a digital format, allowing users to explore and interact with the data, often through 3D models or interactive maps.

3. **Data Analysis:** They often include data analytics tools to process and analyze the vast amount of data associated with the environment, helping identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.

4. **Decision Support:** Environmental digital twins serve as decision support tools for a range of applications, including resource conservation and environmental protection.

5. **Interoperability:** They are designed to work within larger systems and can often be integrated with other digital twins or databases to provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex interactions and relationships in the environment.

Environmental digital twins are valuable tools for understanding and managing various aspects of our environment, helping us address challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, natural resource management, and more. They play a crucial role in enabling data-driven, evidence-based decision-making in these areas.
